# MA-505 Fall 2025 Class Notes
You should find all examples I use in class under the `InClassExamples` folder labeled by the *date* of class. Please fill free to clone this repo if you'd like. 

For exercises, you can find solutions in the `InClassActivities` folder. These will be uploaded after its class time.

For slide deck files, please find that on Moodle :)
